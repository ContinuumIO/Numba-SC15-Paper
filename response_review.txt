All listed mistakes regarding grammar and language is fixed.

A section 4.7 is added to extend the discussion on GPGPU.

Review 3:

Regarding the lack of "real-world" applications examples,
our company has several private-sector and government projects that are using
numba.  The private-sector projects are under NDA and the government projects
require a long public-release approval process.  As a result, we have chosen
not to discuss any real-world application.  In additional, since numba
does not replace the CPython interpreter, numba can indirectly support many
usecases by speeding up the most performance critical part.
