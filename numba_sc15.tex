\section{Background}

Python is a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
It is regarded as a high productivity language due to its simple syntax,
flexible semantic and the large number of libraries.
It has gained popularity in the a scientific computing community,
which has driven the demand of high performance tools.
Among the many performance focused librarys, NumPy is one of the important
scientific library in the Python ecosystem as it provides a n-dimensional
array (ndarray) object that became the foundation of efficient numeric
computation in Python.

A ndarray is a homogenous typed data memory buffer.
Data can be stored in either C contiguous, FORTRAN contiguous or have arbitrary
strides at each dimension.  This allows binding to high performance computing
libraries that are traditionally written in C or FORTRAN, such as BLAS and
LAPACK. The ndarray support array expression: using Python operators on
ndarrays will trigger element-wise operations that are implemented in C
efficiently.  However, a trivial looping of the elements in Python is
inefficient due to the layers of indirection inside interpreted code.

Numba is initially developed to optimize the inefficient use-cases of NumPy.
The layers of indirection for ndarray indexing is flattend into direct loading
from pointers.  Before Numba, NumPy users must write Python C-extension to
implement any custom computation.  The process can be error-prone due to manual
handling of reference counting of Python objects. Numba lets user annotate
the compute-intensive Python function for compilation without changing rewriting
the code.

\section{What is Numba?}

Numba is a just-in-time compiler for CPython.
It exists as a library to CPython and does not replace the interpeter.
Its initial focus is to target a Python subset that makes heavy use of
ndarrays in loops.  The ndarray provides important dimensionality,
type and data layout information that allows Numba to generate specialized
loops for arrays in machine code. By knowing the native structure of ndarray,
it bypasses unnecessary indirection for accessing data in ndarrays.
The basic structure of the ndarray consists of the data pointer to the base of
the memory buffer and two integer arrays for the dimensionality (aka shape) and
the strides. Numba can directly access these fields for calculating the offset
of each element.  As a result, it can generate efficient loops that indexes
into ndarrays that are as fast as their FORTRAN counterpart
(TODO: benchmark for proof). As it continues to develop, the support language
subset is expanding. Currently, it can handle high-level features such as
generators and array expressions.

Unlike most JIT for interpreter languages, Numba does not perform tracing.
Instead, it relies on user annotations for marking the function that requires
compilation. The just-in-time aspect comes from call-site code generation.
To relieve user from the burden of type annotation, Numba inspect the types
of the arguments for local type inference on the callee function.
As a result, it can have accurate type information for each values.
Python duck-typing is supported by overloading the function for each
encountered type combination at the call-site. (Talk about code bloat???)

The semantic of the compiled code slightly differs
from the interpreted. Numba supports a subset of the language only
and violates some semantic of Python.  It does not support big integers
and is limited to 64-bit integer for the maximum representable integer type.
All arithmetic operations on 64-bit integer wraparound when the result
overflow.  Variable type are not polymorphic.  Implicit coercion occurs when
a type is assigned to a variable of a different type. In practice, these
restrictions and deviations from Python semantic rarely affect the user
because the ndarray has similar limitations. On the other hand, these
limitations allow for aggressive optimization.

A novelty of Numba is its multi-target backend.  It currently supports NVIDIA
CUDA backend by using NVVM.  Support for AMD HSA is also available on APU by
using HLC.  Both NVVM and HLC are vendor-specific version of LLVM for
additional support for their hardware.  Multi-target support is an important
reason for the restricted semantic.  Both CUDA and HSA are GPGPU architectures.
Highly divergent code runs inefficiently on GPGPUs due to thread divergence.
Executing certain GPGPU specific constructs, like a thread barrier, by diverged
threads results in undefined behavior. Forcing each variable to be single-typed
avoids implicitly branching that are hidden from user for fine-tuning the
performance and to avoid undefined behavior.

\section{Other Python JIT}

(TODO: Unlaiden Swallon, PyPy, Pyston)

\section{How Numba Works?}

Numba relies on user annotation by using a Python decorator (@jit) on functions.
The decorator subsitute the function object with a special object that triggers
the compilation when called.

\subsection{Compilation Pipeline}

When a decorated function is called the first time, the call arguments are
inspected. The runtime argument types are used to seed the type inference.
Then, the function bytecode is dissemabled by applying control-flow and
data-flow analysis. The control-flow analysis used is rather simple.
The bytecode is scanned for jump targets and loops. Information on loops
can useful for a second round of compilation attempt with type inference fail
due to usage of unsupported types.




\subsection{Type erasure}

(TODO: Numba lowered code does not contain type information)

\subsection{Generating Optimized Code for Ndarray}

(TODO: Convey buffer contiguousness by GEP and not strides.
NumPy uses strides only.)

\subsection{Bypassing the GIL}

\section{Working with LLVM}
Subsection

\subsection{Managing LLVM API}

LLVM development is rapid and its C++ API changes frequently.
In early Numba development, we maintained a python binding, called llvmpy,
to the C++ API and have tried to keep a binding that mirrors the C++ interface,
but this was soon proven to be difficult.
To simplify the binding and to minimize the exposure the to the LLVM C++ API,
we adopted the C API instead and added any missing interface to the C++ API.
The new binding is called llvmlite.  It replicates the C++ IRBuilder API in
pure Python and builds up a string of the LLVM IR.

(TODO: talk about C assertion in LLVM)
